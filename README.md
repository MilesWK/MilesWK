Hello 👋! I am [MilesWK](https://mileswk.com/), a emoji-loving programmer and musician who lives on planet earth!* Fun fact: I love school! My favorite subject is math! My favorite programming language is Python! I even created an [AI Discord Bot Named Jonah](https://jonah-bot.glitch.me/) with Python that is currently live!

**Top Projects 💻:**
- [Jonah Discord bot (https://jonah-bot.glitch.me)](https://jonah-bot.glitch.me) 🐷
  Jonah is an AI Discord bot allowing users to talk with the bot in a direct message setting or mentioning (@) the bot in a server! Jonah also has slash commands for things such as giving random jokes!
- [Texttoolspy Python Module (https://github.com/MilesWK/texttoolspy)](https://github.com/MilesWK/texttoolspy) 📦
  Texttoolspy is more of a test module, that allows users to implement tools such as interactive menus and typewriter style text animation inside python projects without any hastle. This was my first python modules and isn't very good, but still has some potental.
- [My Website (https://mileswk.com)](https://mileswk.com). 🙂
  With each version of my website, the UI and overall website gets better and better. This is version seven, and I will be showing the legacy versions sometime in the future.
