Hello 👋! I am [MilesWK](https://mileswk.com/), a emoji-loving programmer and musician who lives on planet earth! Fun fact: I love school! My favorite subject is math! My favorite programming language is Python! I even created an [AI Discord Bot Named Jonah](https://jonah.mileswk.com/) with Python that is currently live!

**Check out my [blog](https://blog.mileswk.com) to see what I have been up to!**

**Top Projects 💻:**
- [Jonah Discord bot](https://jonah.mileswk.com) 🐷
  Jonah is an AI Discord bot allowing users to talk with the bot in a direct message setting or mentioning (@) the bot in a server! Jonah also has slash commands for things such as giving random jokes!
- [DiscoForge Python Module](https://github.com/MilesWK/DiscoForge) 🔨
  DiscoForge allows you to create Discord bots super quickly and easily, without any hassle, and without any ads.
- [My Website (https://mileswk.com)](https://mileswk.com). 🙂
  Learn all about me! I used GSAP, HTML, CSS, and JS to make this website!
